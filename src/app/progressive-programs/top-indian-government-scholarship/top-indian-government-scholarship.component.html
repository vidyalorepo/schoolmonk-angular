                    <h3>Overview of Indian Government Scholarships</h3>
                    <p>Studying abroad requires two things, merit, and money to support your dream. When it comes to
                        merit and scoring good marks, everyone needs to work hard. But if funding is an issue, you can
                        always rely on a few sources of external support to sponsor your degree at a foreign institute.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Types of Indian Government Scholarships</h3>
                    <p>There are a variety of scholarships available for different levels of students. The right
                        research and preparation can help you obtain the best of them. Scholarships for studying abroad
                        are mainly divided into the following categories:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="lst_type2">

                        <li>Merit-Based: Here, a student’s academic record or achievements in extracurricular
                            activities, such as sports or community service, decide the eligibility and award. An
                            applicant with higher academic excellence is preferred for the scholarship.</li>

                        <li>Student-Centric: Some scholarships are based on the student’s gender, colour, religion,
                            family, etc. Some countries or institutions can also consider scholarships based on a
                            particular medical history or condition.</li>

                        <li>Based on Destination: Several government agencies, governments, and universities award
                            scholarships and funding to students from a specific country. For example, the New Zealand
                            and the United Kingdom governments offer fellowships for overseas students from Commonwealth
                            countries.</li>

                        <li>For Specific Subjects: Students who wish to pursue a specific subject of study may be
                            eligible for grants from certain universities and institutions. For example, if a student
                            wants to study MBA, they can get a scholarship from institutions providing the same for this
                            particular category.</li>

                        <li>According to Needs: These scholarships are awarded based on the student’s financial
                            situation and are aimed at financially challenged students. To obtain these types of
                            scholarships, you may be asked to furnish your family’s income details and submit documents
                            like ITRs, employment certificates, income proofs, etc.</li>

                        <li>For Athletes: This type of scholarship scheme is only available to the best athletes. The
                            grants require you to participate in rigorous training and represent your university at
                            tournaments while balancing your studies.</li>
