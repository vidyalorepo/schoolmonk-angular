                    <p>MBBS abroad is rapidly becoming a top choice for Indian students aspiring to become successful
                        doctors of the highest international repute. The lack of opportunities in India due to high
                        competition and limited MBBS seats urges thousands of Indian students to enroll for MBBS abroad.
                        Russia, Bangladesh, and the Americas, or Caribbean countries, are the best destinations to study
                        MBBS abroad for Indian students. On average, at present, there are over 10,000 Indian students
                        in
                        Russia, more than 7,000 in Bangladesh, and almost 100 in Guyana and Barbados (Caribbean).</p>

                    <p>The top medical universities abroad are well-known for their high-quality medical education,
                        modern
                        teaching methods, excellent infrastructural facilities, well-furnished hostel accommodation,
                        English
                        medical curriculum, globally valid medical degree, and so much more. The fee structure of MBBS
                        abroad for Indian students starts at INR 3 – 6 lakhs a year, including hostel and mess charges.
                        Enroll in the top foreign medical universities and start your MBBS journey for a successful
                        medical
