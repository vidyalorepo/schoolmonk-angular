                        your information. In the spirit of transparency, this Policy provides detailed information about
                        how and when we use cookies on our websites. This cookie policy applies to any Vidyalo.com
                        product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.</p>
                    <h3>1. Does Vidyalo.com uses cookies?</h3>
                    <p>Vidyalo.com uses cookies, tags and other technologies when you use any of the Vidyalo.com
                        websites. Cookies are used to ensure everyone has their best possible experience. Cookies also
                        help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to
                        the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy. If you
                        prefer not to receive cookies , then you should stop using our site, or consult your browsing
                        and third party cookie settings as described below.</p>
                    <h3>2. What is a cookie?</h3>
                    <p>Cookies are small pieces of text stored by a website you visit in your browser and subsequently
                        sent by your web browser in every request to the website. A cookie file is stored in your web
                        browser and allows the Site or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier
                        and the Site more useful to you. Essentially, cookies are a user’s identification card for the
                        Vidyalo.com servers. Cookies allow Vidyalo.com to serve you better and more efficiently, and to
                        personalize your experience on our site. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in the
                        Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign
                        effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may analyse or
                        perform analysis based on the use of these technologies and generate reports on an individual
                        and aggregated basis</p>
                    <p>Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as
                        an existing user, so it’s easier to return to Vidyalo.com or interact with our services without
                        signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read
                        by Vidyalo.com when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services.
                        Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or
                        a browser session).</p>

                    <p>We use cookies on our websites. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us
                        which helps us identify you more quickly when you return. Cookies help us to determine which
                        pages or information you find most useful or interesting on our own websites.</p>
                    <p>Vidyalo.com may also have some cookies for its own analytics i.e. analytics not part of Google
                        Analytics. Such cookies help generate statistics and reports about visitors and their activities
                        on the website or app.</p>
                    <h3>5. How are cookies used for online analytics purposes?</h3>
                    <p>We may use web analytics services on Vidyalo.com, such as those of Google Analytics. These
                        services help us analyse how users use the services, including by noting the third-party website
                        from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or
                        collected directly by such service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of

                        described in the following sections.</p>

                    <h3>6. How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</h3>
                    <p>Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to
                        you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for
                        advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. We
                        work with website analytics and advertising partners, including Google Display Network,
                        Facebook, etc. to deliver Vidyalo.com advertisements on third party publisher websites - these
                        partners may set cookies on your computer's web browser. These cookies allow our partners to
                        recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you Vidyalo.com advertisements elsewhere
                        on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions
                        while using Vidyalo.com services. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, de-identified
                        information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements,
                        whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent
                        visits to Vidyalo.com websites and applications. This information allows an ad network to
                        deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows
                        Vidyalo.com to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our
                        website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that
                        have been shown using the Google Display Network, Facebook for Advertisers, or other online
                        advertising networks. By doing so, we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our
                        website after seeing our ads.</p>

                        feeds. The social networks, such as Facebook, Google, etc. may themselves also put cookies on
                        your machine. If a user logs into Facebook, Twitter or Google+ via our website, they will leave
                        a cookie on the users' computer. This is the same process as if the user logs into these social
                        networks directly.</p>
                    <p>We also use Google Analytics on our Services to help us analyse how our Services are used. Google
                        Analytics uses performance cookies to track customer’s interactions. For example, by using

                    <h3>8. How to control cookies?</h3>
                    <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you
                        choose to turn off these cookies, you will still see advertising on the internet but it may not
                        be tailored to your interests. It does not mean that you won't be served any advertisements
                        whilst you are online. Whilst we have mentioned most of the third parties involved in using
                        targeting or advertising cookies in the preceding section (section g), the list is not
                        exhaustive and is subject to change. Therefore, even if you choose to turn off all the third
                        party cookies listed in section (section g), you may still receive some tailored advertisements
                        and recommendations.</p>
                    <p>There are a number of ways you can manage what cookies are set on your devices. Essential
                        cookies, however, cannot be disabled. If you do not allow certain cookies to be installed, the
                        website may not be accessible to you and/or the performance, features, or services of the
